{"name":"QuickReactions","tagline":"Isomorphic Hello World with React and Node","body":"While working through sample after sample for Node.js and React.js, I experienced a pattern that wasn't very helpful. Instead of truly starting from scratch, the samples kept walking through step-by-step of cloning a working solution.  They'd start with \"Step 1: paste this fully-working code into this file\" and \"Step 2: paste this fully-working code into this other file.\" I was having a hard time finding a breakdown of the concepts being applied.\r\n\r\nI wanted to learn by starting truly from scratch and building the app up in logical, incremental steps. This tutorial uses the following approach:\r\n\r\n1. Create a Hello World web server in Node.js\r\n1. Introduce server-side React.js JSX compilation to use React.js on the server\r\n1. Use Gulp to improve the development workflow\r\n1. Extract a React.js component from the code and render it on the server\r\n1. Introduce a client-side React.js component (without JSX) to render on the page\r\n1. Refactor the client-side component to use JSX\r\n1. Integrate the server-side and client-side React.js usage, achieving an \"Isomorphic\" page\r\n\r\nLet's get started!","google":"UA-11713933-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
